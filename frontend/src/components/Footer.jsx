        <strong>Intelligence Semantic Layer</strong> — This dashboard provides formalized state detection, not trading signals. States are computed from real-time market data (CoinGecko, Kraken) combined with on-chain and governance parameters. Forces marked with <span className="ftr-dot">●</span> are estimated and will be replaced with real data sources.
